## Hands On Session
For this hands on session, we'll be playing with [StyleGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.04948.pdf). Stylegan arguable creates some of the most realistic images of faces we humans have ever synthesized. We'll be borrowing from some great open source work - to get, started clone this repo:

~~~
git clone https://github.com/stephencwelch/stylegan-encoder.git
~~~

Once you have your repo + envinment setup, check out `Play_with_latent_directions.ipynb`!
